                    <h2 class="mb-5">Industrial Projects</h2>

                    <p>During my Ph.D and PostDoc years I had many, interesting chances to collaborate with industrial partners to conduct applied research on real-world data. Many of these project resulted not only in scientific publications on peer-reviewed journals, but also in actionable knowledge. Data analysis and visualization tools were created, enabling the partner Companies to leverage state-of-the-art data analysis pipelines and AI techniques to extract useful insights from their on data.
                        <br>

                    Here follows a brief list of past and ongoing collaborations:</p>


                    <div class="d-flex flex-column flex-md-row justify-content-between">

                            <h3 class="mb-0">Network Analysis for Anti-Financial Crimes</h3>
                            <p> Since September 2022 I am actively involved in the activities of the Anti Financial Crime (AFC) Digital Hub, a collaboration between Intesa Sanpaolo and a selected number of research partners. Specifically, I am exploring the potential of network science to detect anomalies and malicious patterns in cross-country financial activities. As an outcome of this project, our research group is developing an advanced tool for explainable anomaly detection that leverages the power of complex networks. This tool aids in the identification of potential outliers engaging in suspicious activities, aligning with financial regulations. By utilizing network metrics that provide valuable insights into individual nodes, we track changes in node rankings over time, revealing unexpected shifts in their roles. These subtle transformations often require the attention of AFC officers, as they may indicate emerging risks not easily detected through traditional AFC practices. The very first steps of this project were presented and <a class="paper" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3543873.3587602"> published </a> at the FinWeb workshop of The ACM WebConference 2023 in Austin, TX.

                            <p>In partnership with the <b>main Italian National Television</b> (<a class="paper" href="http://www.rai.it/ ">RAI</a>) we developed an AI algorithm based on Transformers Neural Networks to detect emotions in the social media posts and comments of the users about RAI's tv programs. Social media feeds are indeed a powerful - yet somehow under-exploited - source of information on the quality of a product and, maybe even more interestingly, on the users' satisfaction and appreciation. Hundreds of thousands of posts and replies per day were analyzed, to reveal positive (e.g. joy, anticipation, love) and negative (e.g. sadness, fear, anger) emotions expressed by the users towards RAI's programs, actors and hosts. <br> The AI algorithm was finally embedded in a dataviz tool, which is currently used by RAI to probe the reactions of the users on a daily basis, going far beyond a simple sentiment analysis. <br> <a class="class" href="https://www.unito.it/comunicati_stampa/memorai-lintelligenza-artificiale-che-monitora-le-emozioni-dei-telespettatori-sui"> Here </a> is a University press release on the project, while <a class="class" href="https://www.lastampa.it/torino/2019/11/22/video/memorai_l_intelligenza_artificiale_che_monitora_le_emozioni_sui_social-92795/"> here </a> you can see the media coverage on La Stampa, one of the main Italian media outlets.

                    <p>Beside my research interests, I love music. I love everything that has an engine and can be driven, ridden or flown: I am a motorsport enthusiast and I fly light airplanes when I can. If we take engines out of the equation, then I enjoy Scuba Diving. But even there, have you ever tried Diver Propulsion Vehicles?! :) 
                    I like trekking, swimming, being in the countryside, dystopic novels, travel novels and many other things you probably don't care about knowing :) </p>
